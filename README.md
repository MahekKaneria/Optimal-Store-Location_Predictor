### Project Overview

This project aims to identify the next best location to open a store using store sales and median income data. The project involves analyzing a dataset that includes store sales information and the median income of different areas within different cities. By examining the relationship between store sales and median income, the project provides insights to make data-driven decisions for store location planning.

### Files Included

- **store_data.csv**: This dataset contains information about the sales of existing stores in different locations.
- **median_income.csv**: This dataset contains information about the median income of different areas within cities.
- **data_analysis.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook file that demonstrates the data analysis process to determine the next best store location.

### Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were utilized in this project for data analysis and visualization:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing and handling arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.

### Important Information

- **Data Source**: The datasets used are fictional and designed for the purpose of this analysis.
- **Objective**: To recommend potential locations for opening new stores based on data analysis.
- **Methods Used**: The analysis involves statistical methods and machine learning techniques to assess store formats and profitability based on median income.
